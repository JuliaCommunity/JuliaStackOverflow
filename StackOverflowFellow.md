# Julia Stack Overflow Fellow

## What is a Julia Stack Overflow Fellow?

Julia Stack Overflow Fellows will serve as stewards of knowledge from all parts of the Julia Community onto Stack Overflow. Fellows will serve for 3-6 months depending on their knowledgeability to commit. 

Julia Stack Overflow Fellow will post questions in Q/A format designed to highlight Julia concepts/syntax that they think should be shared out. 

## Why do we need Julia Stack Overflow Fellow?

Much of the knowledge of the Julia Community is fragmented between different sources (GitHub, Docs, Discourse, Slack, etc.) so the goal of the Julia Stack Overflow Fellow program is to help integrate and share the information between these sources in one place. Many of these sources (The Docs specifically) get poor SEO rankins so you will not find the answer unless it's cross posted onto another site.

## Why Stack Overflow? 

Despite its flaws, Stack Overflow countinues to be relevant and a helpful resource for many in the programming community.

## What are the requirements to become a Julia Stack Overflow Fellow? 

- A genuine interest and experience with Julia
- A desire to help other programmers
- Experience or the desire to learn about technical writing
- Able to commit to ~5 hours per week for 3-6 months

## Application process

Please email logan@julialang.org with you resume and a sample Stack Overflow post about Julia (you can post the question and then send a link). Note that the questions should be self answered meaning you will pose the question as if you genuinely did not know the answer and then follow up with a thoughtful answer. A particular focus on questions desinged for beginners or new Julia developers is suggested. 

We are currently planning to accept and work with 6 Fellows for the first cohort. 

Applications are due March 15th and the Fellows will be announced on March 29th.
